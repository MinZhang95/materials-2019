# So, you've got an error?

---

## Tools

- `traceback()` - the sequence of calls that led to the error
    - runs after you've gotten the error
- Setting breakpoints
- `browser()` - open an interactive session at an arbitrary breakpoint
    - can be used to create conditional breakpoints
- `debug()` - open an interactive session where the error occurred
    - RStudio has a `rerun with debug` option

### Or... Low Tech

- `print()` statements
- going line-by-line through the code interactively

## Traceback

```
> library(nonpackage)
Error in library(nonpackage) : there is no package called ‘nonpackage’
> traceback()
2: stop(txt, domain = NA)
1: library(nonpackage)
```

## Entering Debug Mode - Breakpoints

1. Set Breakpoints in your functions with Shift+F9 or by clicking on the left of the line number    
![:scale 50%](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201608458/editor-breakpoint.png)

2. 
    - __Inside a function__ Run the computation that causes the error - debug mode should be triggered at the breakpoint
    - __Outside a function__ Source the function with `debugSource()` in RStudio

---

## Entering Debug Mode - `browser()`

1. Add `browser()` to your function at the point where you want to "peek inside" the function's workings    
![:scale 50%](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/201608438/browser-breakpoint.png)

2. Source the code

3. Call the function to get inside at the point where `browser()` is located


---

## Entering Debug Mode - `debug()`

Mark a function for debugging using `debugonce()` or `debug()`

```{r, eval = F}
debugonce(c)
c(1, 2, 3)

c(6:9)
```

Stop `debug(function)` with `undebug(function)`

---

## Working in Debug Mode

- n or Enter: Execute next statement
- s: Step into function
- f: Finish function/loop
- c: Continue
- Q: Stop debugging
- help: Show command list

## Your Turn .tiny[.shift-right[From [Advanced R](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html#debugging-answers)]]

This function should compute the mean of all numeric columns: 
```{r}
col_means <- function(df) {
  numeric <- sapply(df, is.numeric)
  numeric_cols <- df[, numeric]

  data.frame(lapply(numeric_cols, mean))
}
```

Which of the following results are incorrect? Can you modify `col_means()` to be more robust to unusual inputs?

```{r, eval = F}
col_means(mtcars)
col_means(mtcars[, 0])
col_means(mtcars[0, ])
col_means(mtcars[, "mpg", drop = F])
col_means(1:10)
col_means(as.matrix(mtcars))
col_means(as.list(mtcars))
```

---

## Writing Code for Easy Debugging

- Format your code well
- Leave comments 
    - describe what the code is supposed to be doing
    - what the input is supposed to be
    - what the output should look like    
    ...For each functional unit of code
- Check inputs and verify outputs
    - `stopifnot()` in base R
    - `assertthat` package (https://github.com/hadley/assertthat)
        - error signaling, input validation, better error messages
    - `checkmate` package (https://github.com/mllg/checkmate)
        - fast and concise input validation
        
---

## `assertthat`

Compare the error messages:

```{r, error = T}
library(assertthat)
stopifnot(is.character(1:10))
assert_that(is.character(1:10))
```


---

## Other `assertthat` functions

- `is.flag(x)`: is x TRUE or FALSE? (a boolean flag)

- `is.string(x)`: is x a length 1 character vector?

- `has_name(x, nm)`, `x %has_name% nm`: does x have component nm?

- `has_attr(x, attr)`, `x %has_attr% attr`: does x have attribute attr?

- `is.count(x)`: is x a single positive integer?

- `not_empty(x)`: are all dimensions of x greater than 0?

- `noNA(x)`: is x free from missing values?

- `is.dir(path)`: is path a directory?

- `is.writeable(path)`/`is.readable(path)`: is path writeable/readable?

- `has_extension(path, extension)`: does file have given extension?

## Your Turn
Use `assertthat` functions to check inputs and output for the col_means function, ensuring that they make sense.

```{r}
col_means <- function(df) {
  numeric <- sapply(df, is.numeric)
  numeric_cols <- df[, numeric]

  data.frame(lapply(numeric_cols, mean))
}
```

Upload your code to https://gist.github.com/ and see if you can break your neighbor's `col_means()` function

---

## `Checkmate`

Goals: 
- Faster (C backend)
- Better memory handling - no intermediate objects created
- Single call to check e.g. length, missingness, and lower/upper bounds (more concise)

(Preview...) Also interfaces with `testthat` for unit tests.
---

## `Checkmate`

- `assert*` to check type, length, any missing,  type-specific attributes (limits, character lengths, row/col names, ...)    
also `assert_*` if you prefer that syntax
    - Throw an error if the check fails
    - Checked object returned invisibly on success
        - can be used with pipes!

- `test*` return TRUE or FALSE - best used to combine different checks

- `expect*` functions to be used in unit tests

- `check*` functions
    - return error message as a string if the conditions fail
    - return TRUE otherwise
    - used in `assert*`, `test*`, `expect*` functions
